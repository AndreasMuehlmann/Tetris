# Tetris
None of the files are interesting but main.
The others might get filled at some point.
You can make a peace by going into an editor, open main, go down to the main function and make a variable with
1.the colour
2.the turning point
3.the ratio of every square of the peace to the turning point
4.if the peace should be turnable
Do it with the same pattern as the other peaces are written in.
To get a peace spawning in the game you have to put a variable name of a peace into "werte_st√ºcke"
much fun!!
